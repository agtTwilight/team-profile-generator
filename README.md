## Description
**What was your motivation?** <br>
I wanted to generator an HTML document that contained user inputed contact information and team member information. <br><br>
**What problem does your project solve?** <br>
A project manager can user my terminal interface to generate a formatted html document containing employee cards w/ descriptions. No coding experience necessary for the user, just run the terminal application and answer the prompts! <br><br>
**What did you learn from this project?** <br>
I learned how to use async and await w/ promises. I also learned how to create constructors with classes, and store my code in a way that serparates javascript functions by concern, and imports files and functions only when necesssary.
